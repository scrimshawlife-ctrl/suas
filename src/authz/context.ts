/**
 * Authorization context.
 *
 * Spec citations:
 * - SUAS-specs AUTH.md §1 — "Authentication is not authorization. Authorization
 *   remains role + tenant + row + consent/system basis."
 * - SUAS-specs AUTH.md §5 — in-flight authorization after revocation re-evaluates
 *   authoritative user/membership/session state rather than trusting stale client
 *   claims.
 * - SUAS-specs AUTH.md §6 — active user, active membership with the needed role,
 *   server-derived tenant context.
 * - SUAS-specs API.md §4 — the server derives tenant and actor authority; clients
 *   cannot choose an arbitrary tenant scope.
 *
 * The context is rebuilt from the database per request. Nothing here is taken
 * from a client-supplied claim.

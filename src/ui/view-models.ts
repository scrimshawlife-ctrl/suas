/**
 * View models: the only inputs a surface may render.
 *
 * Spec citations:
 * - SUAS-specs MVP_REFERENCE.md §9 (no fabricated zero/placeholder values as
 *   production facts; summaries only when derived from real data)
 * - SUAS-specs MVP_REFERENCE.md §8 (resource data is not timeless hard-coded truth)
 * - SUAS-specs MVP_REFERENCE.md §11 (deterministic fixture data)
 * - SUAS-specs PRIVACY.md (minimum necessary; no veteran address in a surface
 *   that does not need it)
 *
 * Rendering is a pure function of these types. That is what makes §11's
 * fixtures deterministic without a browser or a database, and it keeps the
 * question "may this surface see this field?" answerable by reading one file.
 *
 * A value that is genuinely unknown is modelled as `undefined` or as an
 * explicit `NOT_COMPUTABLE` variant, never as `0` or `'—'`. §9 forbids
 * displaying fabricated placeholder values as production facts, and a metric
 * that defaults to zero is exactly that.

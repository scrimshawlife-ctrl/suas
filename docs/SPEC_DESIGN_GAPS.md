# SPEC_DESIGN_GAPS.md — SUAS-specs design-gap triage

**Released spec stack:** `0.2.0`
**Release manifest:** `RELEASE_MANIFEST-0.2.0.md`
**Specs merge:** `4a722e69ad8f7ff45a9581ca3bdd022bdf524f8f`
**Stage:** `SPEC-017` implementation conformance
**Pilot / production readiness:** `NOT_READY` (unchanged by this document)

## Purpose and governance

This is a **triage catalog of design gaps in the canonical `scrimshawlife-ctrl/SUAS-specs`**
stack `0.2.0`, surfaced while implementing SUAS. It exists to satisfy `AGENTS.md`
rule 3 ("semantic gaps return to specs; do not invent product/domain behavior")
by giving those returns a single tracked home.

It is **not** implementation authority and it **does not**:

- redefine any released product/domain rule (`AGENTS.md` rule 1);
- make, propose values for, or close any owner decision (`AGENTS.md` rules 3, 14, 15);
- upgrade any `UNAVAILABLE` / `MANUAL_ONLY` / `INFORMATION_ONLY` / `FUTURE` surface.

Where an entry notes how the implementation currently behaves, that behavior is
the documented mechanism choice already recorded in the relevant slice
conformance record (`docs/slices/`) — repeated here only as a triage pointer, not
asserted as spec authority.

## How to use this document

Each gap has a stable ID and sits in one of three buckets, chosen by **who can
close it**:

| Bucket                             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                       | Closable by               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **III — Contradiction**            | Two released authorities conflict, or a release contradicts an accepted decision. Resolve first.                                                                              | Owner reconciliation      |
| **I — Editorial / underspecified** | A field/state/rule is named but not defined deterministically, or authorities are mislabeled. No new product decision is required.                                            | Spec patch (no decision)  |
| **II — Owner decision**            | A named or implied `D-0xx` decision, or a value the release explicitly forbids inventing (vendor, capacity, SLO, recovery, legal, scoring, crisis copy, reporting threshold). | Owner decision + evidence |

Suggested triage columns to add per row when this becomes an issue set: `owner`,
`target release`, `status`.

Method and confidence are described at the end. Section numbers are indicative;
the authoritative locus is the named spec file.

## Bucket III — Contradictions / tensions (resolve first)

### G-III-1 — Hardcoded 988 / Veterans Crisis Line (draft) vs D-012 crisis copy forbidden (released) — **RESOLVED BY D-012 (v0.1.5)**

- **Refs:** draft `ISLANDS.md` §4, `SURFACES.md`, `FENCE_POSTS.md` G8 vs released `SAFETY.md` §2/§3.1/§5.1/§9, `SAFETY_COPY.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `COMPLIANCE.md`; `GLOSSARY.md` "Island".
- **Resolution:** D-012 is `DECIDED` in `RELEASE_DECISIONS-0.1.5.md`. Authorized destinations are 911 and the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Implementations render `SAFETY_COPY.md` when `SUAS_SAFETY_COPY_MODE=approved` and MUST NOT invent alternative crisis wording. Draft island-specific numbers remain draft (D-026) and are not authority.
- **Impact:** Closed as a contradiction. Remaining island/draft work is still D-026.

### G-III-2 — D-015 / D-016 `DECIDED` in the register but "open" in domain text — **RESOLVED BY 0.1.6**

- **Refs:** `DECISIONS.md` D-015/D-016 (`DECIDED`) vs prior `CASES.md` / `PRODUCT.md` / `ONBOARDING.md` / `PILOT.md` / `PRIVACY.md` / `GLOSSARY.md` "open" / `INFERRED` wording.
- **Resolution:** `RELEASE_MANIFEST-0.1.6.md` rewrites those files to the v0.1 decided defaults. Decision values are unchanged.
- **Impact:** Domain files now match `DECISIONS.md` for D-015/D-016.

### G-III-3 — SPEC acceptance references an undefined target (effective Support Signal projection) — **RESOLVED BY 0.1.6**

- **Refs:** SPEC-003 historically accepted "effective projection as defined in SPEC-006"; `SUPPORT_SIGNALS.md` §7 left a two-override owner-confirm follow-up.
- **Resolution:** 0.1.6 points SPEC-003 at `SUPPORT_SIGNALS.md` §7.1 / `DATA_MODEL.md` §4 and transcribes the already-implemented two-override / chain rule (named target excluded; remaining candidates by `computed_at DESC`, `support_signal_id DESC`).
- **Impact:** The accepted projection pointer matches the 0.1.4 selection rule (see G-I-24 / P-21).

### G-III-4 — Released manifest/acceptance vs per-file `draft` headers (authority meta-gap) — **PARTIAL (high-traffic closed by 0.1.6)**

- **Refs:** `RELEASE_MANIFEST-0.1.3.md` + SPEC-010/011/013/014 acceptance vs `draft` / `dependency-blocked` headers still on `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `EVENT_MODEL.md`, `CASES.md`, `DISPATCH.md`, `FULFILLMENT.md`, `RESILIENCE.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, and others; SPEC acceptance records still pinned to stack `0.1.0`.
- **Resolution (high-traffic leftover):** 0.1.6 stamps Authority lines on `CASES.md`, `AUTH.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `PILOT.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, `SUPPORT_SIGNALS.md`, and `DATA_MODEL.md` (inline `draft` remains for provenance; manifest wins per `VERSIONING.md` §1). Remaining files still rely on the P-1 manifest-override rule.
- **Impact:** The files implementers open first no longer contradict the manifest. Other stale headers remain covered by P-1.

## Bucket I — Editorial / underspecified (fixable via spec patch; no new decision)

### Vocabulary alignment

- **G-I-1 — Capability naming is four parallel schemes, never mapped.** Category `SHELTER` vs capability id `TEMPORARY_SHELTER_FULFILLMENT` vs port `TemporaryShelterPort` vs `FulfillmentAttempt.capability`. Refs: `DISPATCH.md` §7, `ARCHITECTURE.md` §11, `FULFILLMENT.md`, `APIS.md`, `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`. Impl maps these explicitly in `src/fulfillment/port.ts` (Slice 7 §10 item 2).
- **G-I-2 — Mode enums unrelated.** `integration_mode` (attempt) vs `integration_modes` (resource) vs `fulfillment_mode` (offer). Refs: `FULFILLMENT.md`, `RESOURCES.md`, `PROVIDER_INTEGRATIONS.md`.
- **G-I-3 — Follow-Up counter name mismatch.** `coordination_attempt_count` (`DATA_MODEL.md`) vs `retry_count` (`FOLLOWUP.md`).
- **G-I-4 — `ServiceOffer` (catalog) vs `ProviderOffer` (live) have no join/supersession rule.** Refs: `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `PROVIDER_INTEGRATIONS.md` §6, `DISPATCH.md` §5.
- **G-I-5 — Manual adapter naming (generic vs capability-specific) with no required-adapter registry.** Refs: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PROVIDER_INTEGRATIONS.md`, `FULFILLMENT.md`.

### State machines — undefined or contradictory edges

- **G-I-6 — `ServiceFulfillment.PARTIAL` has no entry trigger** and dispatch requires `COMPLETED` evidence for request `FULFILLED`. Refs: `FULFILLMENT.md`, `DISPATCH.md` §4. (Slice 7 §10 item 3.)
- **G-I-7 — `ServiceFulfillment.DISPUTED` has no transition table** (source states, actors, exits). Refs: `FULFILLMENT.md`.
- **G-I-8 — Fulfillment `FAILED` → request outcome is a non-deterministic disjunction** ("typically `UNFULFILLABLE` or remain actionable"). Refs: `FULFILLMENT.md` §5/§7.
- **G-I-9 — Request `ESCALATED` source set not closed-listed; exit target (`TRIAGED` or `MATCHING`) has no selection rule.** Refs: `DISPATCH.md` §2/§4.
- **G-I-10 — Cancellation/expiry "allowed non-terminal" states described in prose, not enumerated** (both `DISPATCH.md` §4 and `REFERRALS.md` §3).
- **G-I-11 — Follow-Up `RESCHEDULED` / `OVERDUE` / `ESCALATED` transitions + events undefined.** Refs: `FOLLOWUP.md` §2/§7/§9, `EVENT_MODEL.md` §3. Impl returns `RESCHEDULED` to `SCHEDULED` deliberately (Slice 6 §10 items 1, 3).
- **G-I-12 — Case reopen documented only from `CLOSED`, not `RESOLVED`,** despite multi-cycle settlement narrative. Refs: `CASES.md` §4.2, `SETTLEMENT.md` §3.
- **G-I-13 — "Blocking Service Request" for case resolve is never defined** (which request states block?). Refs: `CASES.md` §4/§7. Impl treats any non-terminal request as blocking (Slice 5 §10 item 1).
- **G-I-14 — `ACTIVATE` (`ASSIGNED → ACTIVE`) is implementation-named; qualifying-work trigger undefined.** Refs: `CASES.md` §4. (Slice 5 §10 item 2.)
- **G-I-15 — `SERVICE_FAILED` event emit conditions undefined;** most request transitions (submit, triage, matching, start, confirm, close, cancel, decline, expire, escalate) have **no Domain Event** in the catalog. Refs: `DISPATCH.md` §4, `EVENT_MODEL.md` §3.

### Joins and field shapes

- **G-I-16 — `notifications` has no reference to Case / Service Request / Referral / triggering event.** This makes MVP `RESPONDER_NOTIFIED` unreachable. Refs: `DATA_MODEL.md` §9, `NOTIFICATIONS.md` §3. (Slice 10 §10 item 1; Slice 8 §10 items 3-4.)
- **G-I-17 — `contact_method` / `referral_method` (`RESOURCES.md`) and referral `destination type/id` are unstructured** (no scheme discriminator), so direct actions and validation are not implementable. (Slice 10 §10 item 2; Slice 7 §10.)
- **G-I-18 — Follow-Up `responsible_type` / `referral_id` not modeled/enumerated in the logical schema.** Refs: `FOLLOWUP.md` §3, `DATA_MODEL.md` §6. (Slice 6 §10 item 4.)
- **G-I-19 — Settlement summary field shapes undefined** (structured references vs free text). Refs: `SETTLEMENT.md` §2, `DATA_MODEL.md` §8. (Slice 6 §10 item 6.)
- **G-I-20 — Service Request "required details" per category undefined** (submit validation references them). Refs: `DISPATCH.md` §4, `API.md`.
- **G-I-21 — Current-assignment projection algorithm for a Service Request unspecified** ("deterministic from history" with no rule). Refs: `DISPATCH.md` §6.
- **G-I-22 — `FulfillmentAttempt` reconciliation sub-state appears in `RESILIENCE.md` but not in `DATA_MODEL.md`; ServiceFulfillment cardinality per request undefined.** Refs: `RESILIENCE.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md` §7, `FULFILLMENT.md` §3.

### Consent mechanics

- **G-I-23 — No closed registry of `consent_basis` / system-basis codes.** Many paths allow action on a "documented system basis" with no enumeration. Refs: `CONSENT.md` §3.5/§3.6, `NOTIFICATIONS.md`, `REFERRALS.md`. Impl closes the list to `SYSTEM_INTERNAL_PROCESSING`, `RESPONDER_CASE_ASSIGNMENT` (Slice 4 §10 item 3).
- **G-I-24 — Effective-signal selection rule is defined nowhere** — **RESOLVED BY P-21 (0.1.4) / two-override chain (0.1.6).** Refs: `SUPPORT_SIGNALS.md` §7.1, `DATA_MODEL.md` §4. Most-recent `computed_at`, tie-break by id desc, override supersedes the named target; two overrides of the same target remain candidates (recency then id). Independent of D-011 thresholds.
- **G-I-25 — `grantee_type` / `grantee_id` typing per grantee not specified** (what does the id reference for TRUSTED_CONTACT / RESPONDER / ORGANIZATION / SERVICE_PROVIDER?). Refs: `CONSENT.md` §2. (Slice 4 §10 item 2.)
- **G-I-26 — Purpose-matching is prose, not a comparison rule.** Refs: `CONSENT.md` §3.4. (Slice 4 §10 item 5.)
- **G-I-27 — Permission/scope vocabulary is illustrative ("e.g."), not closed;** unknown-pair accept/reject undefined. Refs: `CONSENT.md` §2.1. Impl closes it via `PERMITTED_SCOPES`.
- **G-I-28 — `priority_signal_level` and the "signal-driven case open/update" action are referenced but not modeled** in `CASES.md` / `DATA_MODEL.md`; no named command. Refs: `SAFETY.md` §3.2, `RESPONDER_WORKFLOWS.md` §4, `CASES.md` §3. (Slice 5 §10 item 4; Slice 9 §10 item 7.)

### MVP UI ↔ domain mapping

- **G-I-29 — QRF UI labels have no normative mapping table to Case/Request/notification facts.** Refs: `MVP_REFERENCE.md` §7.2, `DISPATCH.md` §2.
- **G-I-30 — Responder on-duty/availability has no state machine, events, or matching tie-in** (`active_for_queue` only, with "optional" unspecified fields). Refs: `MVP_REFERENCE.md` §9, `RESPONDER_WORKFLOWS.md` §10, `ADMIN.md` §4. (Slice 10 §10 item 3.)
- **G-I-31 — Chat / persistent messaging is UI-required with no domain entity** (thread/message store, consent scope, API). Refs: `MVP_REFERENCE.md` §5. (Slice 10 §10 item 4.)
- **G-I-32 — Four responder dashboard metrics have no definitions/data sources.** Refs: `MVP_REFERENCE.md` §9. (Slice 10 §10 item 6.)
- **G-I-33 — "Quick Resource Share" is named with no domain action / consent rule.** Refs: `MVP_REFERENCE.md` §9.

### Auth constants and versioning clarity

- **G-I-34 — Challenge TTL, session idle/absolute timeout, MFA elevation TTL, rate-limit bounds all `INFERRED`/unset;** cross-instance revocation "security window" undefined. Refs: `AUTH.md` §3/§5, `SECURITY.md` §2. Impl gathers all as labelled `INFERRED` constants (Slice 3 §10 item 3).
- **G-I-35 — Tenant resolution at sign-in for a passwordless contact undefined** (challenge endpoints take a client-supplied `tenant_id`; pre-tenant vs post-enrollment binding gap). Refs: `AUTH.md` §2, `DATA_MODEL.md` §2, `ONBOARDING.md` §7.1. (Slice 3 §10 item 1.)
- **G-I-36 — SUAS-admin global role has no released representation** (roles modeled only on org memberships). Refs: `AUTH.md` §6, `DATA_MODEL.md` §2. Impl uses an auditable `suas_admin_grants` table (Slice 3 §10 item 2).
- **G-I-37 — Notification template rendering contract and policy vocabulary (event → recipient/channel/dedupe) not enumerated;** webhook auth/retry bounds qualitative. Refs: `NOTIFICATIONS.md` §1/§5/§6/§8. (Slice 8 §10 items 2-6.)
- **G-I-38 — Consent-template publication is required for grants but absent from bootstrap hard-gates and admin APIs.** Refs: `CONSENT.md` §6, `ADMIN.md` §2, `ONBOARDING.md`, `APIS.md`. (Slice 4 §10 item 8.)
- **G-I-39 — Five parallel version identities + unset runtime-content versions; DB schema-version mechanism format unspecified.** Refs: `VERSIONING.md` §3, `RELEASE_MANIFEST-0.1.3.md`, `ENVIRONMENT.md` §9. (Slice 1 §10 item 6.)

## Bucket II — Owner decisions (cannot be invented)

These require an owner decision and/or external evidence; the release forbids
inventing them (`AGENTS.md` rule 15; `DECISIONS.md` "Do not invent signal
weights, crisis copy, legal status, capacity/SLO/RTO/RPO numbers, or reporting
privacy thresholds"). Deferral is safe today only because the corresponding
production surface is `UNAVAILABLE` / manual-only.

## Notable structural observations

- **Analytics is better off than it looks.** `ANALYTICS.md` §3 operational metrics
  (enrollment, check-in completion, case/request distributions, time-to-assignment,
  fulfillment/confirmation separation) are defined and computable on synthetic
  data; only production aggregate/small-cell reporting and percentiles are
  D-025-blocked, and §4 metrics are intentionally `NOT_COMPUTABLE`.
- **The implementation is a de-facto gap tracker.** Every Bucket I item was hit
  while building and carries a documented, tested mechanism choice in the slice
  records. Ratifying those into spec patches is the cheapest way to close Bucket I.
- **Draft Rev 3 files are non-authoritative** (`README.md`, file headers;
  `FRICTION.md` states its proposals are not accepted), yet `GLOSSARY.md` (released)
  references the draft "Island" contract — the one place draft leaks into released
  terminology (G-III-1, G-III-4).

## Method and confidence

Built from (a) a direct read of the released `SUAS-specs` `0.1.3` cut and
(b) the implementation's own returned-to-specs records in `docs/slices/`. Items
that also appear in a slice record carry a `(Slice N §10 item M)` pointer and are
high-confidence (independently surfaced by building against the spec). Section
numbers are indicative; the authoritative locus is the named spec file. This
document makes no readiness claim and closes no decision.

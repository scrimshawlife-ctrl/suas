# SPEC_GAP_PLAN.md — Remaining spec-gap close sequence

**Status:** `PLAN` (not implementation authority)
**Against:** released `SUAS-specs` **0.2.0** (`4a722e69`) and implementation pin `src/release/pins.ts`
**Companion:** `docs/SPEC_DESIGN_GAPS.md` (catalog), `docs/SPEC_GAP_PROPOSALS.md` (P-1..P-23, already ratified in 0.1.4)
**Readiness:** `NOT_READY` (unchanged). Nothing here authorizes production, real veteran data, or SPEC-018.

This plan sequences the **remaining** gaps after:

- **0.1.4** — Bucket I proposals P-1..P-23 ratified (`RELEASE_MANIFEST-0.1.4.md`).
- **0.1.5** — D-012 / G-III-1 closed (`SAFETY_COPY.md`).
- **0.1.6** — Wave A editorial hygiene (G-III-2 / G-III-3 / high-traffic G-III-4). Closes no D-0xx.
- **0.2.0** — Wave B D-011 (`qv-001` + `sv-001`). G-I-28 transcribed as `APPLY_EFFECTIVE_SIGNAL` (RED only; not a D-0xx).

It does **not** invent scoring, crisis copy, legal status, vendor, capacity, SLO, RTO/RPO, or reporting-threshold values (`AGENTS.md` rules 3, 14, 15).

## 0. Current state

| Layer                      | State                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implementation slices 1–11 | Built; SPEC-017 evidence in `docs/SPEC017_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md` |
| Codified Bucket I          | P-1..P-23 in specs 0.1.4; P-12/P-13 implemented in this repo   |
| Safety copy                | D-012 `DECIDED`; UI gated by `SUAS_SAFETY_COPY_MODE`           |
| Production scoring         | D-011 `DECIDED` (`sv-001` registered); env stays `fixture`     |
| Pilot / production         | Blocked on SPEC-018 + remaining Bucket II                      |

**Close shape** (repeat for every wave that needs a spec release):

1. Owner accepts the values or editorial text (this plan names _what_ must be decided, not _which_ value).
2. Canonical patch in `SUAS-specs`: artifact + `RELEASE_DECISIONS-0.1.x.md` (if a D-0xx) + `RELEASE_MANIFEST-0.1.x.md` + `DECISIONS.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / lineage.
3. Owner merges the specs PR (lifecycle is owner-controlled).
4. Implementation re-pins and implements only what that release authorized.

## 2. Remaining work, in waves

Waves are sequential for _authority_ (later waves may start in parallel once their inputs exist). Do not skip Wave B if the goal is live Check-In → Case.

```text
Wave A  hygiene (no new product value)
   ↓
Wave B  D-011 scoring contract          ← DONE (0.2.0); G-I-28 transcribed (RED only)
   ↓
Wave C  leftover Bucket I product rules
   ↓
Wave D  remaining capability adapters
   ↓
Wave E  SPEC-018 / pilot cluster
   ↓
Wave F  draft Rev 3 (islands)           ← defer
```

### Wave A — Spec hygiene (no new product decision) — **DONE (0.1.6)**

**Goal:** Make already-decided rules readable in the files implementers open first. Target: a small `0.1.6` editorial release.

**Released** as `SUAS-specs` `0.1.6` (`5074812e`, [specs PR #9](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/suas-specs/pull/9)). G-I-4 was **not** included (no `ServiceOffer`/`ProviderOffer` join exists in this repo to transcribe).

| **G-III-2**          | Replace “D-015/D-016 open / `INFERRED`” prose with the 0.1.0 decided defaults                            | `CASES.md` §8.1 (still titled “D-015 open”); `AUTH.md` (D-016 `INFERRED`); `PRODUCT.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `PILOT.md`, `PRIVACY.md` if they still say open | **No.** Values are already in `DECISIONS.md` / `RELEASE_DECISIONS-0.1.0.md`.                                                                                         |

If unstated, keep current impl (override supersedes its target; newest `computed_at` wins). |
| **G-III-4 leftover** | High-traffic stale headers (closed in 0.1.6). Remaining `draft` / `0.1.0` headers on lower-traffic files | Same files P-1 listed                                                                                                                                     | **Partial.** 0.1.6 stamped high-traffic files. Lower-traffic leftovers stay documented, not silently treated as unreleased.                                          |
| **G-I-4**            | `ServiceOffer` (catalog) vs `ProviderOffer` (live) join/supersession                                     | `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `PROVIDER_INTEGRATIONS.md` §6, `DISPATCH.md` §5                                                                                        | **Only if** no current impl rule can be transcribed. First pass: document whatever the router already does; do not invent a new offer lifecycle.                     |

**Exit:** An implementer reading `CASES.md` / `AUTH.md` / `SUPPORT_SIGNALS.md` does not see a contradiction with `DECISIONS.md`.

### Wave B — D-011 Support Signal scoring — **DONE (0.2.0)**

**Goal:** Released scoring contract so a Check-In can produce a `GREEN|YELLOW|ORANGE|RED` label without inventing weights.

**Released** as `SUAS-specs` `0.2.0` (`4a722e69`, [specs PR #10](https://github.com/scrimshawlife-ctrl/suas-specs/pull/10)). This repo registers `sv-001` with `released: true` and keeps TEST/CI on `SUAS_SUPPORT_SIGNAL_MODE=fixture`.

**Already built before the close:** engine interface, computation identity, settlement, override rows, `SUAS_SUPPORT_SIGNAL_MODE=disabled|fixture`, free text excluded from canonical input (`src/signals/*`, Slice 9).

**Owner must supply all of the following** (see prior D-011 brief). A close that omits any row is not implementable:

| #   | Decide                                                                                                                                                  | Released home                                                                        | Bound                                                                   |

| B2  | Deterministic scoring: canonical answers + `signal_version` + questionnaire version → `level` + inspectable `basis`                                     | Same artifact                                                                        | `SUPPORT_SIGNALS.md` §2 — no generative primary signal                  |
| B3  | Incomplete-input rule: refuse (today) **or** a deterministic missing-input function                                                                     | Same artifact + `CHECKINS.md` §4.1                                                   | Until closed, production compute from `INCOMPLETE` stays forbidden      |
| B4  | Golden vectors: fixed inputs → expected `level` + `basis` for that version                                                                              | `TESTING.md` §3.1 / §12                                                              | Stay `UNRELEASED_FIXTURE` until this table is released                  |
| B5  | Immutable `signal_version` id (+ matching questionnaire version)                                                                                        | `VERSIONING.md` runtime-content identities; admin publish path                       | New version writes new rows; never mutates history                      |

**Also decide with D-011 or immediately after (depends on scores existing):**

| ID                | Why it rides with D-011                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **G-I-28 action** | **Transcribed.** Command `APPLY_EFFECTIVE_SIGNAL`; one apply per settled `support_signal_id`; non-RED is a no-op; CLOSED opens a new case (does not REOPEN). |

**Not D-011:** effective-signal _selection_ (P-21), abandoned Check-In idle timeout (`CHECKINS.md` §4.2), island/crisis numbers (D-026).

**Close shape:** `RELEASE_DECISIONS-0.2.0.md` + `SIGNAL_SCORING.md` + golden vectors + D-011 → `DECIDED`. Implementation registered one `released: true` engine and kept TEST on fixture.

**Exit:** GV-001–GV-014 pass as released conformance fixtures. CHECK-IN gate does not advance. G-I-28 is transcribed as `APPLY_EFFECTIVE_SIGNAL` (RED opens/updates; non-RED is a no-op; CLOSED is not REOPEN). Still not SPEC-018. The live Check-In job still does not compute/settle on its own.

### Wave C — Leftover Bucket I that needs a product/policy choice

These were **intentionally excluded** from P-1..P-23 (`SPEC_GAP_PROPOSALS.md` “Not proposed here”). Each needs a rule, not just a header fix.

Do **C1** before more fulfillment-adapter work. Do **C2** before claiming event-catalog completeness. **C3–C5** unblock UI/auth completeness; they can proceed in parallel with Wave D.

#### C1 — Fulfillment outcomes (correctness-critical)

| ID        | Decision the owner must make                                                                                                   | Why it cannot be inferred                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **G-I-6** | Who may declare `ServiceFulfillment.PARTIAL`, on what evidence, and whether a request may become `FULFILLED` from partial work | Dispatch currently wants `COMPLETED` evidence for `FULFILLED` |
| **G-I-7** | Full `DISPUTED` table: legal source states, who may dispute, exits besides “never back to `CONFIRMED`” (already implemented)   | Only the dispute _edge_ is specified                          |
| **G-I-8** | Deterministic map: fulfillment `FAILED` → request `UNFULFILLABLE` **or** remain actionable (and when)                          | Spec today is a disjunction                                   |

#### C2 — Events and settlement shape

| **G-I-20** | Per-category “required details” on Service Request submit (`FOOD` / `TRANSPORTATION` / `SHELTER` / `PEER_SUPPORT`)                                                                                         |

#### C3 — Responder / MVP surfaces (UI-required, domain-absent)

| ID         | Decision                                                                                                | Blocked surface                                    |

| **G-I-33** | Quick Resource Share: domain action + consent rule                                                      | Share control                                      |

#### C4 — Auth / tenancy

| ID         | Decision                                                                                                                                                    |

#### C5 — Notifications / consent templates

| ID         | Decision                                                                                                      |

**Exit:** Each accepted item becomes a 0.1.x spec patch in the P-n style (codify if impl already has a tested rule; otherwise owner writes the rule first).

### Wave D — Remaining capability adapters

| ID        | Status           | What to decide                                                                                               | Unblocks                               |
| --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **D-019** | Pending          | Production food adapter family + field-level disclosure projection (or explicit “manual-only through pilot”) | FOOD API path                          |
| **D-020** | Pending          | External peer-support adapter + projection (or explicit “manual/QRF only through pilot”)                     | External PEER_SUPPORT                  |
| **D-010** | Future / pending | Who pays; reservation/payment architecture                                                                   | Amadeus reservation; Uber payment auth |

D-017/D-018 stay decided. Wave D does not require D-011 unless the adapter path is signal-triggered.

---

### Wave E — SPEC-018 / pilot cluster (do not start for “more product”)

These close **readiness**, not SPEC-017 conformance. Group for one owner sitting if possible.

| Cluster          | IDs                 | Decide                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Comms / identity | D-002, D-003, D-004 | Auth, SMS, email providers (and MFA factor taxonomy)     |
| Infra            | D-001, D-005, D-022 | Hosting, production DB, durable job product              |
| Legal / data     | D-006, D-007, D-013 | HIPAA classification, retention/deletion, counsel review |
| Pilot ops        | D-008, D-009        | Partner orgs, responder coverage hours                   |
| Maps             | D-014               | Production geocoding / “near you”                        |
| Envelopes        | D-021, D-023, D-024 | Capacity, SLOs/alerts, RTO/RPO                           |
| Reporting        | D-025               | Small-cell / aggregate privacy                           |

**Un-numbered, same wave when touched:** encryption key management; Follow-Up retry ceiling; Trusted Contact `relationship_label` enum; lost-all-channel recovery; SUAS-admin break-glass/dual-control; abandoned Check-In idle timeout.

**Exit:** SPEC-018 evidence can be collected. Still a separate stage from this plan.

---

### Wave F — Draft Rev 3 (defer)

**D-026–D-032** (island_id vs tenant, dispatcher routing, resource curation, reporting vs minimization, dual-enrollment/minors, contracting entity, volunteer-driver screening).

Draft files are not authority. Do not implement islands, anonymous front door, or extra crisis numbers. G-III-1 leftover (“Island” in `GLOSSARY.md`) is editorial-only until D-026.

## 3. Recommended owner order

Smallest set that unblocks the most _product_ (not hosting):

| Priority | Item                                                 | Why this next                                                                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Wave A** (G-III-2, leftover headers)               | **Done** in specs `0.1.6`. This repo re-pins to that stack.                                             |
| 2        | **Wave B — D-011**                                   | **Done** in specs `0.2.0`. This repo registers `sv-001`.                                                |
| 2b       | **G-I-28 action**                                    | **Transcribed** as `APPLY_EFFECTIVE_SIGNAL`. Live Check-In job still does not compute/settle.           |
| 3        | **Wave C1** (G-I-6/7/8)                              | Stops fulfillment edge-case invention                                                                   |
| 4        | **Wave D — D-019/D-020** (or “manual through pilot”) | Admin enable/disable of the accepted catalog is already the add/remove path. Food/peer APIs still wait. |
| 5        | **G-I-30** if live QRF matching is the next UX goal  | Dashboard/on-duty truth                                                                                 |
| 6        | **D-010** when reservation/payment is in scope       | Unblocks Amadeus book + Uber pay                                                                        |
| 7        | **Wave E** when a real pilot date exists             | SPEC-018                                                                                                |

## 4. Execution notes for the next agent

- Canonical repo for Waves A–F spec text: `scrimshawlife-ctrl/SUAS-specs`. This repo only re-pins after a specs merge.
- Do not encode Wave B–E values in implementation first. D-012 was the opposite order (decision then code) and is the pattern to keep.
- Wave A is released as editorial `0.1.6` (no new owner values). This repo re-pins after that merge.
- After any specs merge: update `src/release/pins.ts`, `.env.example`, `tests/helpers/env.ts`, `tests/setup.ts`, `.github/workflows/verify.yml`, and the handoff docs together.
- Catalog hygiene: when a wave merges, mark the gap `RESOLVED` in `docs/SPEC_DESIGN_GAPS.md` the way G-III-1 / D-012 were marked.

---

## 5. Out of scope

- Inventing D-011 weights, golden vectors, or questionnaire wording. D-011 is released; transcribe only.
- Treating `SUAS_SAFETY_COPY_MODE=approved` as the TEST/CI default.
- Advancing any `TESTING.md` readiness gate.
- Implementing draft Rev 3 islands or extra hotlines.
- Claiming SPEC-017 “complete” in `STATUS.md` (owner records that).
